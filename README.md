# Plastic Waste in the United States of America

Between 1980 and 2018 plastic generation has risen drastically, leaving behind a large carbon footprint and a large quantity of mismanaged waste. This project focuses on the need for plastic waste regulation and illustrates this in the following data visualizations.

Note: color pallete chosen with colorblind accessibility in mind.
