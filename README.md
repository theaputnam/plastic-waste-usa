# Plastic Waste in the United States of America

Between 1980 and 2018 plastic generation has risen drastically, leaving behind a large carbon footprint and a large quantity of mismanaged waste. This project focuses on the need for plastic waste regulation and illustrates this in the following data visualizations.

Note: color pallete chosen with colorblind accessibility in mind.

## Visualizations

Over time, most plastic is dumped in a landfill while extraordinarily little is recycled or combusted for energy recovery.

Microplastics found at the surface of the ocean have steadily increased between 1950 and 2020 and will continue increasing in the future according to future forcasts.

When comparing different countries, the United States of America had the highest plastic waste per capita in 2016.
